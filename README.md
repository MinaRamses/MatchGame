# MatchGame

The game engine randomly mix up the cards.
Lay them in rows, face down.
Turn over any two cards.
If the two cards match, keeo it up and continue to get the rest.
If they don't match, turn them back over.
Tip: Remember what was on each card and where it was. "Watch and remember"
There is a time of 30-40 seconds to get them all
Win/Lose condition: The game is over when all the cards have been matched or time is up.

Good luck and hope you enjoyed the app.
